## File Relationships <a name="anchor_1"></a> [top](#anchor_main)
1. testDerivative.m is main().
2. derive.m is a sub-function that is called by the main().

* Below will cover contents of the main().

## Fixed Difference Between Each X <a name="anchor_2"></a> [top](#anchor_main)
* Setting figure part; Setting properties of the figure
* Drawing part; Simple plotting of diff(sin) & cos
* Note that the derivation of the sin can be spot on match with the cos wave when properly shifted.

## Not Fixed Difference Between Each X <a name="anchor_3"></a> [top](#anchor_main)
* Changing difference part; This part calculates error between the diff(sin) & cos under a condition where intervals of x coordinates continuously decrease.

## Other Functions <a name="anchor_4"></a> [top](#anchor_main)
* Declaring some anonymous functions part; Literally...
* Derivations part; Respective derivations at zero bound (upper & below)
* Drawing part; Respective drawing at zero bound (upper & below)
